      <br>
      There is a pernicious and dangerous lie I continue to hear regarding bike safety:  That wearing a helmet actually makes you <i>more</i> likely to take risks while biking.  The rationale being that the feeling of security offered by 400 grams of styrofoam turns us into careless idiots.  As if you strap a bike helmet on and suddenly think you're inpervious to cars and trucks.
      <br>
      <br>
      It takes 20 seconds to google statistics on how many lives are saved by bike helmets.  One could argue that it takes more work to stay uninformed on the matter.  What <i>really</i> gets my panties in a bunch is when I hear somebody casually repeat this particular bit of fake news.
      <br>
      <br>
      Don't be that guy.

      Bikers get murdered by cars <i>every fucking day.</i>

      Helmets save lives.

    I like drinking and I like biking.  I'm good at both.  I have crashed on snow, I've crashed on gravel, I've crashed at night and during the day, I have broken bones and gotten stitches.
    <br>
    <br>
    I shudder to think about that type of violence occuring <i>to my head</i>, unmitigated by a helmet. It totally bums me out.
    <br>
    <br>
    Collectively, we are all struggling to cope with the complexties of this stupid world.  If you really think you're kicking so much ass you'd accept a handicap, go jump in a lake.  Wear a helmet.

        Smashing your brain across an intersection is expensive.
        <br>
        <br>
        Save yourself some medical bills by avoiding getting maimed in public.  Nobody wants to see what your thinky-bits look like smeared all over the asphalt.  Brains are <i>gross.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        Since our healthcare system in this country sucks as it is, don't muck things up by making emergency personnel have to deal with an avoidable <i>brain injury.</i>
