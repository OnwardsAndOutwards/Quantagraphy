          <i>~Actual human garbage</i>
      </h2>
      <p>
      <br>
      There is a pernicious and dangerous lie I continue to hear regarding bike safety:  That wearing a helmet actually makes you <i>more</i> likely to take risks while biking.  The rationale being that the feeling of security offered by 400 grams of styrofoam turns us into careless idiots.  As if you strap a bike helmet on and suddenly think you're inpervious to cars and trucks.
      <br>
      <br>
      It takes 20 seconds to google statistics on how many lives are saved by bike helmets.  One could argue that it takes more work to stay uninformed on the matter.  What <i>really</i> gets my panties in a bunch is when I hear somebody casually repeat this particular bit of fake news.
      <br>
      <br>
      Don't be that guy.
