        Hunting Wild Mushrooms is Safe, Rewarding and Fun.

        <h2>I love hunting for wild mushrooms.</h2>
        <p>
            Since I live in the <a>Pacific Northwest</a> and spend a lot of time in the woods camping and hiking, I get to enjoy a fine variety of wild edible mushrooms almost year-round. This is one of the reasons why living in Oregon is probably way
            better than living wherever you eek out an existance.
            <br>
            <br>Sometimes I'll hit a veritable jackpot of chanterelles, lobster or oyster mushrooms and I'll fill my backpack with choice edibles to share with my friends. Wild mushrooms are more varied and flavorful than anything you'll ever find in
            a grocery store, and make wonderful additions to almost any meal.
            <br>
            <br>Time and time again, however, my excitement will be met with a typical skepticism:
            <br>
            <br> The notion that wild mushrooms can and will kill you.

        <h2>There are a lot of different types of the fungus we call "mushrooms"</h2>
        <p>78% are nontoxic <br> 20% are poisonous <br>1% are deadly <br> 1% are psycoactive.
            <br>

            <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00275514.2018.1479561?journalCode=umyc20">Science.</a>
            <br>
            <br> Most of the "poisonous" ones will merely give you a stomach ache, not kill you instantly. The <i>deadly</i> ones tend to be all white and unlike anything else you'll learn to be edible. If you see something that looks exactly like a white
            buttom mushroom from the grocery store, don't eat it.
            <br>
            <br> The taboo that exists around foraging mushrooms is unique to our culture. America likes it's trucks, football, reality television and is for some reason weirdly suspicious of wild fungus on the dinner table. Asian and European cultures
            love and is appreciate mushroom hunting, and they aren't keeling over and dying from touching a toadstool.
            <br>
            <br> Maybe Americans are just too stupid to forage for their own food. I am fully prepared to beleive this.
            <br>
            <br> There are 8,000 species of edible mushrooms in the world, with incredibly varied flavors and textures. Some, like the morel (my favorite) are earthy and almost meaty, while others like the lobster mushroom has flesh the consistancy of...
            well, lobster.
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Tasty indeed.</p>

        <h2>You can correctly identify almost any mushroom with the right book.</h2>
        <p>Go to your local library and check out one of the many books on fungus identification. Trust me, the library misses you and wants to see you, even though you haven't been there in forever.
            <br>
            <br>Now go to the woods and look for cool mushrooms. Bring some beer or whatever.
            <br>
            <br>When you find some, look them up. It's important to do this <i>before</i> eating them.</p> Once you're certain you've found something <i>not</i> poisonous, pick that bad boy. He'll have friends close by. If you find one that looks exactly
        like one the book says will poison and kill you, maybe <i>don't</i> pick and eat it.

            Get your hunt on. Mushroom hunting and mycology in general are incredibly fun and rewarding activities. The act of finding something edible growing in the woods will tickle your little monkey brain, I promise. You'll have fun hunting for them, you'll
            have fun gathering them, and you'll have fun sharing them. Just don't do anything stupid and you'll see what I mean. People sometimes get sick when they don't identify what they have, but it happens infrequently enough that it's really of
            little concern. Furthermore, if you're the type of person who just eats a mystery mushroom, we can safely assume that your genes are probably better left out of the population at large, and humanity would benifit from not having you out and
            about, voting and driving an automobile.
