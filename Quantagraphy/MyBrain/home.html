      <h2>Oregon is beautiful.</h2>
      <p>How Beautiful?  It's fucking insane.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>53 percent </strong>of Oregon is public land, owned and managed by the federal and state government.  Camp on the beaches.  Camp in the forest.  Camp in the desert.  You can get drunk with your friends with the world as your backdrop in some of the most stunning landscapes on the planet.
      <br>
      <br>
      Waterfalls.  Volcanoes.  Hot Springs.  Redwoods.  Crater Fucking Lake.  California to the south, Washington to the North.  The Pacific to the West and the desert to the East.
      <br>
      <br>
      Did I mention the whole coast is essentially one giagantic park?  All beach areas in Oregon, from California up to Washington, you could walk the entire way without setting foot on private property.  Except you couldn't because a lot of the coast consists of rocky cliffs that will <i>kill you.</i>

    <h2>We're progressive AF</h2>
    <p>Oregon does what it wants, and what it wants is so liberal I sometimes forget what the rest of the country is like.  We're big on enviromental and consumer protection. Plus, <strong>no sales tax.</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>The hippies get a lot right</h2>
      <p></p>
      Like hobbits, hippies are a source of organic vegetables and high quality cannabis.

    <h2>You do you</h2>
    <p>Nobody seems to care what anybody else does in Oregon.  The people are fundamentally chill and accepting.  The beer is great, the climate is perfect. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Do you know that during the winter I can choose to drive an hour to the beach if it's sunny, or drive an hour in the other direction to ski in the mountains?
      <br>
      <br>
      It's literally the best.</p>
